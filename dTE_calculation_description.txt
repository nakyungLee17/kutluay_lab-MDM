For each donor and timepoint, the counts of mock and IFN-treated samples from RNAseq and ribosome profiling (riboseq) were used to calculate the delta translation efficiency (delta TE). The counts were first filtered by cpm > 1 in at least a number of samples equal to the number of replicates. Log CPM was then taken with parameter prior.count set to 1. A sample's TE was calculated by subtracting the RNAseq log(CPM) from the riboseq log(CPM). Then the mean mock TE was subtracted from mean IFN-treated TE to generate delta TE.

The RNAseq log fold change (logFC) was then plotted against delta TE. Genes in cytokine activity pathway and defense response to virus pathway (pathway genes) were colored in orange. Top 20 pathway genes with the highest RNAseq logFC were labeled. Additionally, genes with RNAseq logFC > 3 and delta TE < -4 were labeled.
