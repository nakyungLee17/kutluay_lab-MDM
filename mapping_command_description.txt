RNA sequencing reads were aligned to the GRCh37 human genome using the STAR aligner. Relevant parameters were: --outSAMstrandField intronMotif, --outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.04.

Ribosome profiling reads were first aligned to an rRNA reference. rRNA alignments were discarded and unmapped reads were then aligned to the GRCh37 genome using the STAR aligner. Revelant parameters were: --outSAMstrandField intronMotif, --outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.04,  --outSAMattributes All, --quantMode TranscriptomeSAM.

Gene counts were generated by featureCounts using GRCh37 annotation and sorted BAM files. Additional parameters specified were: -t exon, -g gene_id. "Geneid" and "count" columns in the count files were selected to generate the reduced count files.
